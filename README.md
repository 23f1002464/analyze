# Data Processing and CI/CD Pipeline

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data processing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. It involves converting raw Excel data, processing it with Python and Pandas, ensuring code quality with Ruff, and automating deployment of results using GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages.

## Project Overview

The core of this project is to take a raw Excel file (`data.xlsx`), convert it into a more processable CSV format (`data.csv`), and then use a Python script (`execute.py`) to perform specific data transformations and aggregations. The output of this script is a JSON file (`result.json`), which is then automatically published online.

## Features

*   **`execute.py`**: A robust Python script built with Pandas 2.3+ that reads `data.csv`, performs data cleaning, validation, and aggregation, and outputs the processed data as `result.json`. The script has been fixed to handle common data issues like missing columns, non-numeric values, and empty files.
*   **Data Conversion**: `data.xlsx` is provided and converted to `data.csv` for efficient processing. `data.csv` is committed to the repository.
*   **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**:
    *   **Code Quality**: Integration of `ruff` for linting Python code, ensuring adherence to best practices and catching potential issues early.
    *   **Automated Execution**: The `execute.py` script is automatically run on every push to the `main` branch.
    *   **Result Publication**: `result.json` (generated by `execute.py`) is published to GitHub Pages, making the processed data easily accessible.
*   **Responsive HTML App (`index.html`)**: A simple, responsive web page using Tailwind CSS that provides an overview of the project and a direct link to the published `result.json`.

## Setup (Local Development)

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Set up Python Environment:**
    Ensure you have Python 3.11 or newer installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas==2.3.0 ruff
    ```

4.  **Convert `data.xlsx` to `data.csv`:**
    *Note: `data.csv` is already committed to the repository. This step is for understanding the origin.* If you need to regenerate `data.csv` from `data.xlsx`, you can use a simple Python script or a spreadsheet editor.
    Example Python snippet (if `data.csv` were not committed):
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_excel('data.xlsx')
    df.to_csv('data.csv', index=False)
    ```

5.  **Run Ruff Linter (Optional, but recommended):**
    ```bash
    ruff check .
    ```

6.  **Execute the Data Processing Script:**
    ```bash
    python execute.py > result.json
    ```
    This will generate `result.json` in your project root with the processed data.

## GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file defines the CI/CD pipeline that automatically runs on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.

*   **Linting**: Ruff checks the Python code for style and potential errors.
*   **Execution**: `execute.py` is run, generating `result.json`.
*   **Deployment**: The generated `result.json` is uploaded as a GitHub Pages artifact and automatically deployed to your repository's GitHub Pages site.

You can view the processed `result.json` live at:
`https://<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>/result.json`
(Remember to replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>` and `<YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>` with your actual GitHub details.)
